=head1 NAME

MooseX::AbstractMethod - Declare methods requirements that must be satisfied

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::Abstract;

    requires 'bar';

    # synonm to 'requires'
    abstract 'foo';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extensions allows classes to flag certain methods as being required to be
implemented by a subclass, much as a L<Moose::Role> does with 'requires'.

=head1 USAGE

As in the synopsis, simply mark certain methods as being required by
subclasses by passing their names to "abstract" or "requires".  This will
cause a method of the same name to be installed in the class that will die
horribly if it's ever called.  Additionally, when a class is made immutable,
all of its methods are checked to see if they're marked as abstract; if any
abstract methods exists that were not created in the current class, we die
horribly.

Checking for method satisfaction on make_immutable isn't perfect, but AFAICT
it's the most reasonable approach possible at the moment.  (Corrections
welcome.)
